This fork contains _only_ the keyboard driver, and has been very, very slightly modified to compile with platformio (an "end" was removed from an .asm file) - everything else is identical to the original.


# Adafruit-Trinket-USB
Arduino libraries allowing Trinket to act as USB devices

NOTE:  This folder contains multiple libraries.  Each library must be installed individually.  Simply installing the master folder won't work.  Move each library folder out of the master after you unzip into your libraries folder.
